Flask-sustainable
=================

|Supported Python versions| |License|

| Flask-Sustainable is an extension for Flask that provides a simple way to add sustainability to your application.
| This is done by compressing the HTTP responses as soon as possible.  
| More, HTTP headers are used so that the server can return information on the performance of the application.

Two types of headers are used:

- indicators
- scores

Get started 🚀
--------------

Installation 📦
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the extension with pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install flask-sustainable
    # Or
    pip install git+https://github.com/av1m/flask-sustainable.git

Try it out 🔬
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

💡 The code is available in `example.py <./example.py>`_ file

.. code:: python

    import flask
    from flask_sustainable import Sustainable
    from flask_sustainable.indicator import PerfCPU, PerfRAM, PerfTime

    app = flask.Flask(__name__)
    sustainable = Sustainable(app)  # Invoke Sustainable().init_app(app)
    sustainable.add_indicators(PerfTime(), PerfCPU(), PerfRAM)

    @app.route("/")
    def helloWorld():
        return "Hello, World!"

Then, try with cURL or Postman (or any other HTTP client):

.. code:: bash

    $ curl http://localhost:5000/ -I -H "Perf: Perf-Time,Perf-CPU Perf-RAM"

    Perf-Time: 0.76592
    Perf-RAM: 0.12114
    Perf-CPU: 0.97900

Developers 👨‍💻
----------------

Use python3 or python command (depending on your configuration)
There is a `Makefile <Makefile>`_ for helping with development.

1. Clone this project

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/av1m/flask-sustainable.git
    cd flask-sustainable

2. Run make command

.. code:: bash

    make install

1. Run a sample; a server is running on port 5000

.. code:: bash
    
    python example.py

Everything has been installed and configured correctly! 🎊
Once you modify the code, you can run `make format` and `make test` commands to check the code style and test coverage (through `make coverage`).

To find out all the available commands, you can use `make help` :

.. code:: bash

    help              Display callable targets.
    test              Run all tests.
    coverage          Run all tests and generate coverage report.
    requirements      Install requirements.
    install           Install package.
    run               Run a example script.
    format            Format code.

Tests 🧪
~~~~~~~~

A simple set of tests is included in `tests/ <./tests>`_.
To run, simply invoke `make test` or `pytest`.
You can also run a coverage report with `make coverage`.
